# Blackjack

### Description
This game was created as my midterm project for the Software Engineering I class at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell.
The purpose of the project was to implement Blackjack using MVC (Model-View-Controller) design patterns. The language we
implemented it in did not matter, so I chose Java, my primary language.

### Challenges
Most of the challenges I faced in the project were in figuring out the difference between the Controller and the Model.
There was some early confusion as to which was which, but once I figured that out, and after doing some independent reading,
many websites had many different interpretation of MVC. Fortunately I was able to find one that most closely matched what
we went over in class, and was able to implement it. The second largest challenge was figuring out how to communicate between
the different components of the pattern in Java syntax. However, once I overcame that obstacle, I realized just how
easy it would be to swap something out in my implementation as opposed to other approaches I've used in past games.

### How to Play
I went for a very simplistic implementation, so playing is very simple. You are immediately presented with a starting hand,
and there are buttons for you to Hit or Stay. There is a third button, Next, which will let you play another game once the
current game has ended. If you are not familiar with the rules to Blackjack, you can find a short tutorial [here](http://www.hollywoodindiana.com/Casino/Tables/Blackjack).

### Credits
All programming was done by me, but the playing card sprite sheet was found [here](http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs271/js-work/cards.png).
